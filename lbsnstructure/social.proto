/*
 * Social Facet of the Common LBSN Data Structure
 *
 * **[Who?](https://lbsn.vgiscience.org/structure/facets/#social-facet)**
 *
 * Overview of LBSN Structures that are organized under the Social Facet:
 *
 * | Object | Description |
 * | ----- | ----------- |
 * | [Origin](#lbsn.structure.Origin) | A Location Based Social Network consisting of a large group of people |
 * | [CompositeKey](#lbsn.structure.CompositeKey) | A Composite Key used to reference unique objects across different LBSN |
 * | [User](#lbsn.structure.User) | A single user (e.g. a profile or an account) on a location based social network (LBSN) |
 * | [UserGroup](#lbsn.structure.UserGroup) | A single group of users on a LBSN |
 * | [Language](#lbsn.structure.Language) | A common language used on LBSN, relating to a larger group of people sharing the same language |
 *
 * Note that these assignments are not clear-cut - e.g. they're aspects of a User that may as well belong to one of the other facets.

 * the Social Facet because Social Media Networks are formed by large groups of
 * people (the social part) around some common interest
 * (e.g. Flickr or Instagram for photography,
 * Twitter for opinion formation and exchange of political perspectives).
 *
 * While OriginIDs are entirely open, we added a list of predefined common
